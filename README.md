# Arxiv Analysis
Hi there!
This was a school assignment where the goal was to work with the data from arxiv.org which is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for over two million scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.
It was necessary to make sense of these large data structures to extract information that could be of use.
